Meeting with students is my highest priority during these times. Feel free to come by **even if you don't have a question or a problem**. Please e-mail me if you'd like to schedule an appointment for a different time.

I sometimes need to modify my schedule to account for meetings and other campus events.

## Official Course Description

**CMS 380 Simulation and Stochastic Modeling**: Explores the use of probability theory and statistical methods in the development of computer simulations used to study/model real-world phenomenon. Topics include an overview of probability theory, a survey of common statistical distributions, random number generation, and common techniques for creating models that incorporate randomness, such as queueing networks and Markov chains. Prerequisite: CMS 170.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Write programs that use randomness to model complex systems.

2. Discuss some of the most common discrete and continuous probability distributions and apply them to modeling problems.

3. Implement a complex discrete-time event-driven simulation model.

4. Use Markov chains and related mathematical techniques to model systems that change over time.

5. Intelligently evaluate system performance using analytical and simulated models and discuss design tradeoffs.

## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your earlier courses.

### How Does It Work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting two weeks. Each sprint covers one unit of material. There will be seven sprints in our course.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll be given a list of learning topics for the sprint, a curated list of resources (videos, readings, worked examples, etc.), and a set of required deliverables due at the end of the two-week period.

3. Working with a team, you'll have broad freedom to decide how to use the available resources to learn the required material and complete the sprint deliverables. You can decide on your own meeting schedule, what resources to use, and your own plan for finishing the projects. Scrumage gives you **options** and the freedom to determine your own best learning approach.

4. When we meet in person (or as a virtual group, if necessary), we'll use that time for short lectures on **the topics you request**, to answer your questions, and check your work-in-progress. You can make an **expert request** to ask for a short lecture, worked example, or other help with a particular topic.

5. Each sprint ends with an individual quiz reviewing the material from the sprint.

6. You'll complete a brief reflection at the end of each sprint, which will help you understand your own learning process and make improvements before the next sprint.

### That Sounds Hard. Why Are We Doing This?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

### More Details

Some of you have already taken one or more Scrumage courses with me or Dr. Summet. If this is your second or third Scrumage experience, you'll find the rhythms of this course to be similar to your previous courses. If this is your first time, don't worry: the course format may feel a little unusual at first, but you'll adapt to it quickly.

I'm using Scrumage for all of my classes this semester because it performed well during our emergency transition to remote learning in the spring. Scrumage gives us a lot of
features that are useful for hybrid courses:

- You're automatically connected to other students in the class, so you have allies already in place if we need to change formats.

- It keeps the course on an overall schedule, but gives you flexibility for how to manage your time within each sprint. Flexibility emerged as an important theme in feedback
from the Spring semester.

- It gives me lots of options for how to adjust the schedule if we need to. The sprint-based structure means that we're never more than two weeks from a reset point, and I
can adjust the content and deliverables for each sprint in response to changing conditions.

### FAQs

- *How big are the teams?* In previous classes, most teams have been four or five students. For this semester, I think smaller is better, so most teams will be threes, with
a few twos and fours.

- *What if I don't want to be on a team?* Working by yourself is allowed, although you should check with me first.

- *Does my grade depend on my team?* I approach the deliverables for each sprint as individual
assignments that can be completed with the help of your teammates, rather than "team projects". Most Scrumage teams operate more like collaborative study groups rather than
divide-and-conquer project teams that you might have used in other classes.

- *What if I can't work with my teammates? Do I have to stay in the same team?* You're allowed to change teams at the start of each sprint. One goal of Scrumage is to help you
think about the kind of collaboration that works best for your learning. It's okay to recognize that some people in the class are your friends, but that you'd be better off
working with a different group that's a better fit for your style.

- *Will we be able to meet in person?* That's still an open question at this point. It might be possible for small groups to meet in some (socially-distanced) spaces on 
campus. Even if that is possible, you should plan on a significant amount of remote collaboration. In addition to WebEx, we'll be using collaborative tools like Slack and
GitHub that are widely used in industry. I'd also emphasize that **remote work is a skill**, and it's likely that many tech companies will continue to be mostly remote for
at least the next year and others will choose to make a large-scale transition to a remote-first working philosophy.

- *What if I'm participating virtually?* To the greatest extent possible, we'll build virtual-only teams to avoid hybrid mixtures of in-person and virtual students.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Assignments and Scoring
We'll have five kinds of assignments in the class:

1. Short reflective pieces completed at the end of each sprint.
2. Team deliverables due at the end of each sprint.
3. Indvidual quizzes
4. Two major projects, due at the ends of sprints 4 and 7.
5. A final exam.

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. 
A "satisfactory" assignment corresponds to a B-level performance, which is **a higher standard** than we often associate with that term. It means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

I'll grade the quizzes on a scale from 0 to 3:

0. No submission, or too incomplete to grade.
1. Shows effort, but has serious issues.
2. Satisfactory.
3. Excellent, complete and correct with an attention to detail and insight that goes beyond satisfactory.

You can earn a **bonus point** on a quiz if either:

1. Every member of your team earns a 2 or 3.
2. You improve your individual performance relative to the last quiz.

### Final Letter Grades

**To earn a B**, you must meet the following six criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of all reflective assignments and concept maps.
2. Satisfactory completion of *N - 1* quizzes (I'll ignore your lowest quiz).
3. Satisfactory work on all of the team sprint deliverables.
4. Satisfactory work on major project #1.
5. Satisfactory work on major project #2.
6. Satisfactory performance on the final exam.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for a B**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| For unsatisfactory performance on              | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| One quiz beyond the one you're allowed to drop | Half a letter grade (e.g. B to B-)       |
| Additional quizzes                             | A full letter grade (e.g. B to C)        |
| One team deliverable                           | Half a letter grade                      |
| Additional team deliverables                   | A full letter grade                      |
| A major project                                | A full letter grade                      |
| The final exam                                 | A full letter grade                      |
| Failure to complete all reflective assignments | A full letter grade                      |
| Failure to submit an assignment                | Double the regular penalty for an unsatisfactory submission |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you fail to achieve satisfactory performance on two quizzes (beyond the one you're allowed drop), your base grade would be lowered by 1.5 letters, from B to C-.

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional work that shows deeper engagement with the course goals.

| For successfully completing                         | Your grade will be adjusted upwards by   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| A challenge assignment (there will be at least two) | Half a letter grade                      |
| An in-depth reflective writing assignment           | Half a letter grade                      |
| Bonus points on a majority of the quizzes           | Half a letter grade                      |

If your grade drops, you can still complete extra work to boost it up. For example, you could struggle with one team deliverable, but
complete the reflective writing assignment. The two would cancel each other out and your grade would remain a B.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It gives you choices for how to attain higher grades. You can boost your grade by completing individual programming assignments, superior team-based projects, or an in-depth reflection.

4. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

5. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

6. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### What About My Partial Credit?

You may feel uncomfortable about the two-level grading scale. This will pass.

1. Two-level grading is faster, so I will be able to return work more quickly and put more effort into giving you meaningful feedback.

2. Two-level grading is more consistent. It's easier to sort work into two bins, rather than slicing it into 100 possible points.

3. Each project will have a spec that clearly explains the requirements for satisfactory work. You can also ask me (through the expert request form) for an evaluation of your work-in-progress.

4. Again, industry doesn't give partial credit. If you're asked to code a feature or prepare a presentation, you ultimately either perform at a satisfactory level or you don't.

5. There are at least four ways to increase your grade. You only need three of them to move from the satisfactory B to an A.

## Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.

### Citation	Expectations
As	per	the	Academic	Honor	Code,	plagiarism	is	defined	as	“Offering the words, facts,
or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise.” In	order	to	avoid	
plagiarism,	all	students	are	expected	to	use	proper	citation	norms.	For	our	course,	
all	assignments	will	use	[faculty	choice	- MLA,	Chicago,	APA,	etc]	citation	style.	

### Absences	– Religious	Holidays	and/or	Campus	Business
The	professor	will	accommodate	a	reasonable	number	of	excused	absences	for	
religious	holidays	and	official	off-campus	college	business	such	as	academic	
conference	presentations	and	athletic	competitions.	However,	per	the	College’s	
policy	on	excused	absences	
(http://www.rollins.edu/catalogue/academic_regulations.html#class-attendance),	
students	must	discuss	with	the	professor	the	dates	of	the	anticipated	absences	no	
later	than	the	last	day	of	the	drop	period.	Students	must	present	to	their	professor	
written	evidence	of	the	anticipated	absences	and	discuss	with	him/her	how	and	
when	make-up	work	should	be	completed	prior	to	missing	the	class.	Students	
should	not	expect	to	receive	allowance	for	excused	absences	if	they	do	not	meet	
with	the	professor	beforehand	and	clarify	the	dates	as	necessary.	Absences	will	be	
addressed	by	the	faculty	member	in	accordance	with	his/her	attendance	policy.	The	
professor	retains	the	right	to	determine	what	would	be	considered	to	be	a	
reasonable	number	of	absences	(excused	or	otherwise)	for	the	course.	A	student	
will	not	fail	a	course	because	the	number	of	religious	observances	and/or	college	
business	absences	exceed	the	number	of	absences	allowed,	except	if	excessive	
absences	make	it	impossible	to	fulfill	the	expectations	of	the	course.	The	student’s	
class	participation	grade	in	the	course,	though,	may	still	be	affected.

### Credit	Hour	Statement	for	Rollins	Courses
This	course	is	a	four-credit-hour	course	that	meets	three	hours	per	week.	The	value	
of four	credit	hours	results,	in	part,	from	work	expected	of	enrolled	students	both	
inside	and	outside	the	classroom. Rollins	faculty	require	that	students	average	at	
least	2	½	hours	of	outside	work	for	every	hour	of	scheduled	class	time. In	this	
course,	the	additional	outside-of-class	expectations	are	self-directed learning and
substantial team-based projects.

### Recording	Device Use
In	order	to	protect	the	integrity	of	the	classroom	experience,	the	use	of	recording	
devices	is	limited	to	either	the	expressed	permission	of	the	faculty	member	or	with
